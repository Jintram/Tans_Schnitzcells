TODO SHOULD BE REMOVED
-   Edited DJK_schnitzfield
    introduced field badseglistname to optional input arguments 
    (probably was there once?)



*******************


-   Changed gainpos switch in imsettings.m. 
    It now can handle emtpy returns from the search function.
    The current copy has this change, implemented by Dmitry. 
    The file I edited has been renamed to Ximsettings.m, and is not used any more.


-   str2 function was missing, now using sprintf instead, in file 
    DE_adjustiminfo.m.
