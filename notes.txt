comment on version 18-01-12, by Philippe

- new segmentation algorithm (PN_segPhase)
- cutCellWidth is replaced by neckDepth : the smaller neckDepth, the more agressive the cutting.
- it is not necessary anymore to maintain a version for Matlab 704

comment to version 17-01-12, by Noreen:

- Schnitzcells is now generalized for any fluorescence colour. fluorescence colours are initialized as properties of 'p'.
  Hence, use the new excel-sheet(!), where the fluorescence colours are initialized and added as function inputs correctly.
- Functions are now either independent of fluorescence images, written for 3 arbitrary colors ('....3colors.m') or require the specific color as function input ('....anycoor.m'). No more color specific functions!
- Fluorescence and Phase Image treatment are separated. Fluorescence data is now initialized --after-- segmentation is finished.
- DJK_manualcheckseg allows to fill the cells, which can be useful if they are manually connected by 2 lines in the interior is then filled. Press 'i'.
- In the segmentation algorithm, special treatment for cells growing on rich medium is added. Call extra option in PN_segmoviephase_3colors with ( 'medium','rich' ). PN_segmoviephase_3colors only initializes the medium as a field in 'p'.
- Names of created folders for fluorescence data and names of fluorescence images adjusted to make name creation more consistent. BUT: Old data might not be recognized by new schnitzcell!

************************************
NOTE:
I did not change functions apart from the standard functions for evaluation and plotting. If you use more exotic functions (e.g. for trouble shooting) and run into some hazzle because they have not been adapted yet to the new handling of fluorescence colors -> let me know and I adjust them!!

comment to version 30-11-11, by Noreen:

- main Schnitzcell folder contains update to new matlab version (R2010b, actually everything starting R2007a)
- subfolder matlab704 contains version for old matlab

This version of schnitzcells integrates :
- a new segmentation algorithm
- templates to perform the full analysis for experiments comprising 1 or 2 colors

It is suited for matlab 7.0.4
