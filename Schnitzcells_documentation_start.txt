PART 1
HOW TO USE EXCEL FILE AND MATLAB TO ANALYZE A POSITION
____________________________________________________________

The Schnitzcells analysis constists of different steps. 

(Step 0: Cropping the images)

Step 1: Segmentation of the cells
===
- The segmentation needs to be checked manually; There is a matlab function available to correct the segmentation (.._manualcheckseg()) and a function which tries to detect mistakes. It is convenient to combine the use of these two functions. The advised procedure is as follows:
    o First, run .._manualcheckseg() once to correct obvious errors. Cells that look incorrect to the algorithm are colored white by this function.
    o Second, run DJK_analyzeSeg(), this will identify cases which the algorithm thinks are incorrect. These can be corrected by running .._manualcheckseg() again.
    DJK_analyzeSeg() produces the following output which gives information about incorrect segmentation:
    > analysis\segmentation\fitRange1_199
    This is also printed to screen, but has a list of possible problems for tracking.



NOTES: There are some "hidden" settings to the algorithm that determines whether cells might be incorrectly segmented. 
Settings in PN_imshowlabel:
- fractionbelowwhite = 0.2; 
    cells which are a fraction of <fractionbelowwhite> smaller than the median are marked white.



Step 2:

SOME NOTES ON SEGMENTATION

THE L STRUCTURE

The "L" structure contains the segmented bacteria. This is simply a N * M matrix with zeros with each area that comprises a bacteria marked by a unique number that is not zero. N * M equals the pixel size of the picture.
